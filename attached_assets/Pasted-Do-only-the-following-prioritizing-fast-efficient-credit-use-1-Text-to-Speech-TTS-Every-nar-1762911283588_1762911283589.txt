Do only the following, prioritizing fast, efficient credit use:

1. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
* Every narration/dialogue line must trigger Text-to-Speech automatically as that text appears on screen.
* Use the browser’s native SpeechSynthesis API for all TTS.
    * Use most “serious” or “narrator” voice available (preferably Indian English if present; otherwise, choose the most neutral/non-childlike English option).
    * If unsure, let user pick from available voices at the start (if trivial/optional), otherwise default to the best one.
* Text and voice must always be in sync (i.e., TTS reads out the current visible text only), and every narration/dialogue/choice step must have TTS before continuing.

2. Fix/Insert These Specific Script Steps
After Timmarusu says:
“My King, it has been a point of conflict for centuries! It rightfully belongs to our empire, but is currently held by our enemies, the Bahmani Sultanates; specifically Adil Shah of Bijapur.”
INSERT THIS (with TTS):
Narrator: "You know the threat of Adil Shah and decide to send a merchant with a large sum of gold to purchase the finest war horses for your army. But, soon, one of your spies brings you disturbing news."
THEN the choice box should say:
"Find out what it is!"

After the spy says:
"Your Majesty, I bring grave news. The merchant has betrayed you. He has taken your gold and has offered his services to your sworn enemy, Adil Shah of Bijapur!"
INSERT THIS (with TTS):
"Your blood boils. This is treachery! What will you do?"
THEN offer the two choice buttons.

After the Prime Minister says:
"My King, let us plan, gather our full strength, and show the Sultanates the true might of Vijayanagar."
INSERT THIS (with TTS):
"What do you do?"
THEN offer:
* Listen to Timmarusu (prepare for full-scale war)
* Launch immediate attack

3. Remove This (Edit Narration):
"You heed Timmarusu's counsel. For months, the empire prepares for war. Finally, the battle begins with a deafening roar from your war instruments, a sound so loud it is said that birds fell from the trees. Your initial attack pushes the enemy back. But then, Adil Shah unleashes his cannons."
SHOULD BECOME:
"You heed Timmarusu's counsel. For months, the empire prepares for war. Finally, the battle begins. Your initial attack pushes the enemy back. But then, Adil Shah unleashes his cannons."

4. Credit/Publishing Consideration
* Only execute what is above and nothing extra.
* Keep current visual/interactivity logic as is.
* No added code beyond what is needed to implement these, to ensure you do not exceed credits and still can publish your site.
