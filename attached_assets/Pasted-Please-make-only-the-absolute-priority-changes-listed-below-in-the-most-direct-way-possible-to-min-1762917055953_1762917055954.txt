Please make only the absolute priority changes listed below, in the most direct way possible, to minimize additional credit usage.
Do not refactor or adjust anything except exactly what’s asked.
Skip non-essential/secondary changes unless all priorities are completed within minimal compute.

1. Critical: Narrator Voice Must Be Deep and Impactful
* Change the text-to-speech (TTS) voice for all narration/dialogue to a strong, bold, deep, hoarse, “documentary narrator” style voice.
* Use the browser’s SpeechSynthesis API voice with the deepest/most serious timbre (not a child or female or chipper voice—must be deep and commanding).
* If browser/OS TTS options are limited, programmatically select all available TTS voices and choose the deepest/most 'narrator' voice.
* If this cannot be guaranteed programmatically, display a dropdown or auto-select the “best match,” and provide instructions for students to switch to a recommended desktop browser for the best voice.
* This is absolute priority 1.

2. Critical: Highlight Key Words for Quiz Recall
Make these very specific text changes—bigger font, bold, and dark contrasting color as described (e.g. dark brown or that fits current theme):
* Landing slide:
    * "1520" and "Krishnadeva Raya" → bold, much larger font, different dark contrasting color.
* Prime Minister’s line:
    * "Raichur Doab", "Krishna", and "Tungabhadra" → highlighted.
    * The name "Prime Minister" or "Timmarusu" should also stand out (bold/color/bigger, etc.).
* Conflict/Enemies line:
    * "Bahmani Sultanates" and "Adil Shah of Bijapur" → highlighted/bold/dark contrasting color.
* Victory line:
    * "Raichur Doab", "Bidar", "Gulbarga", "Bijapur" → highlighted as above.
Use span/style classes or whatever is current standard in codebase, for fast minimal intervention.

3. Critical: Quiz Option Rewrites
For each quiz question, update the options as follows (delete all other options):
* When did the Battle of Raichur happen?
    * 1520
    * 2015
* What region was captured?
    * Raichur Doab
    * Raipur Doab
* Where was the Doab located?
    * Between rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra
    * Between rivers Kaveri and Ganga
* Which two kingdoms fought the battle?
    * Bahamani and Vijayanagar
    * Pandyas and Cholas
* Which other forts were captured?
    * Bidar, Gulbarga and Bijapur
    * Gwalior, Golconda and Agra
* What is the name of your Prime Minister?
    * Timmarusu
    * Tiramisu

4. Critical: Overflowing Choice Text
* Review all choice boxes (choices/buttons throughout story and quiz).
* For any that overflow their background/box, increase box size, adjust padding, or set word-wrap so all text is visible cleanly inside the button/box on all screen sizes.
* No text should spill outside or get visually truncated.

5. Secondary/Nice-to-have: Animated Visuals
* ONLY IF there is credit/computation room after all critical items:
    * Replace simple fade/static image transitions with animated/moving visuals (e.g. motion in battle, characters moving or acting in court), preferably with existing code/asset libraries, GIFs, Lotties, or light-weight sprite animations.
* Otherwise, skip or just add TODO comments where animated assets would go in the future.

6. Low Priority
* In the line:"Your Majesty, I bring grave news. The merchant has betrayed you. He has taken your gold and has offered his services to your sworn enemy, Adil Shah of Bijapur!" 
* Remove the text "of Bijapur!" after "Adil Shah".
* Only do this if it does not impact credits for the above changes.

Instructions:
1. Do items 1–4 only (absolute priorities).
2. ONLY proceed to items 5 and 6 if the above are fully done/committed and there is remaining compute/credit.
