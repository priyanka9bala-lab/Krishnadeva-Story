Project Objective:
Build a vertical, web-based interactive storytelling demo about King Krishnadeva Raya and the Battle of Raichur (1520, Indian history), using the script below. This is a fast prototype: use placeholder images and MP3 audio wherever needed. The most important things are vividness, branching logic, and usability.

Key Requirements:
1. Visuals & UX
    * Use stock or AI-generated placeholder illustrations (for Indian kings, palaces, armies, rivers, etc.) for every major scene and character. Choose images that reflect authentic Indian styles, but speed is top priority.
    * For characters, you may use stock avatars with Indian features or use generic avatars with Indian names underneath.
    * Use clear, colorful, mobile-friendly layouts. Make sure it looks engaging on both desktop and phone.
2. Audio Narration & Dialogue
    * Use royalty-free or AI-generated placeholder MP3s for narration and key dialogues (for now, 2–3 sec audio files, or record your own short test files if possible). Indicate when real content is to be swapped in.
    * Play audio automatically as text displays. Include simple audio controls (play/pause/mute/replay for each section).
3. Story Flow & Interactivity
    * The story scrolls vertically as users progress.
    * At each choice point, show buttons. The user’s decisions drive story branches as in the script.
    * After the story, present a multiple-choice quiz. Each answer gives instant color feedback (correct=green, wrong=red and then reveal the right one in green).
    * Show a final story summary and “Restart Story” button at the end.
4. Ease of Editing & Reuse
    * Store all story content, choices, and quiz data in easily-editable JSON or JS objects.
    * All placeholder image/audio URLs should be easy to swap with final assets later.
5. Implementation
    * Use the fastest, simplest tech stack you recommend (React, Svelte, or Vanilla JS fine).
    * If you need to use external placeholder assets, Unsplash, Pixabay, or similar free resources are fine for demo images. Use any free TTS or stock mp3s for audio.
    * Keep the code simple and focused: no login, no data storage, just interactive story and quiz.

NOTES TO DEVELOPER:
* Use placeholder image and mp3 filenames in code and make it easy to swap for final art/audio.
* Focus on visual clarity, branching logic, and working interactive demo.
* Do NOT include login or database—single anonymous user flow only.
* Make navigation and replay options obvious.
