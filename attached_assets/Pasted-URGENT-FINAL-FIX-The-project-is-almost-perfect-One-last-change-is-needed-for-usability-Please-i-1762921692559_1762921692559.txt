URGENT & FINAL FIX: The project is almost perfect. One last change is needed for usability. Please implement only this one fix with minimal credit usage.
The Problem:
When the story text finishes, the choice boxes appear correctly, but they are off-screen on mobile and some desktop views, forcing the user to scroll manually to see them. This is confusing.
The Solution (Implement Exactly as Described):
You will use JavaScript to automatically scroll the choice boxes into view the moment they appear.
1. Identify the Target Element: Find the div or container that holds the choice buttons. Let's call it choicesContainer.
2. Locate the Trigger Point: In your JavaScript, find the exact line of code where the choicesContainer is made visible (e.g., where its display is set to block or flex, or visibility is set to visible).
3. Add This Line of Code: Immediately after the code that makes the choice boxes visible, add the following JavaScript command:
choicesContainer.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'end' });
(Note: Use the actual variable name for your choice box container)

Code Example for Clarity:
// This is an EXAMPLE of what your code might look like.

function showChoices() {
  const choicesContainer = document.getElementById('choice-box-container'); // Or your actual selector

  // --- YOUR EXISTING CODE THAT MAKES THE BOXES VISIBLE ---
  choicesContainer.style.display = 'flex';
  // --- END OF EXISTING CODE ---


  // *** ADD THIS NEW LINE IMMEDIATELY AFTER ***
  choicesContainer.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'end' });
}

Why This Works:
* scrollIntoView() is a standard browser command that scrolls the page to make an element visible.
* { behavior: 'smooth' } makes the scroll look clean and professional, not jarring.
* { block: 'end' } helps align the bottom of the container with the bottom of the viewport, which is usually what's desired in this scenario.
Final Instruction:
Do nothing else. Just add this single line of auto-scrolling code in the correct place to fix the user flow. This will provide the seamless experience needed.
